The regression lines of carbon production ver- sus the different fractions of the phyto- plankton populations shown in Table 2 in- dicate that even if the presence of the dinoflagellates could be explained by a physical mechanism, the population was actively growing and was responsible for a high percentage of the total primary pro- ductivity. Furthermore, the estimated growth rate for the dinoflagellate popula- tion, 0.82-0.79 d-l, agrees with the field values for the whole phytoplankton popula- tion (Walsh et al. 1974). An independent estimate of the contribu- tion of the dinoflagellates to the produc- tion of the area can be made by using the chlorophyll content and assimilation index of both fractions-dinoflagellates and nan- noplankton. Based on a ratio of GonyauZax to nannoplankton of 24 : 1 in chlorophyll content and 1 : 2 in assimilation index (Holmes et al. 1967; Malone 1970) for all the stations where the ratio Gonyaulax : Table 3.
